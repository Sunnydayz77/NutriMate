<!-- Title: A working title for your app. (Feel free to have some fun with this.) -->

Title: NutriMate

<!-- Description: 4 to 5 sentences summarizing the features, functions, and goals. -->

Decription: NutriMate is an app that details nutritional information to the user. Users can type in any food item and get nutritional information such as calorie ammount, ammount of sugars, and ingredient lists. The main page will have a search bar for the main database of food items that renders a nutrional label of information along with a rotating quote at the bottom about nutritional health. Time permitted, I also plan to make a seperate tab for a food journal for users to type into and take notes on.

<!-- MVP: Write out what your goals are for MVP, including the minimum, need-to-have features of your app. -->

MVP:

1. HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
2. Render nutritional data to the DOM via Nutritionix Axios/API.
3. Use flexbox to design a nutritional facts box.
4. Make sure that the design is scalable and responsive to mac, tablet, and mobile.
5. Host the NutriMate app on Surge.

<!-- Post-MVP: Write out what your goals are for post-MVP, including nice-to-have features that you would like to implement once your MVP is complete. -->

Post-MVP:

1. Locate and use a second API that renders nutritional health quotes and helpful information on the front page.
2. Create a second page where users can input their information into a daily food journal.
3. Make the health quotes fade in and out without the having to leave the page/refresh the page.
